If you're unsure what to do with your time do something on this list. No particular orer but in general the higher up it is the more high priority it is.

1) Compare numerical and analytical results

2) Plot equipotential lines and electric field

3) Show the influence of the charge density on the electric field on the plot

4) Get parser working fully
  4.1) Relative co-ordinates
  4.2) Fix seg fault

5) Pull everything together into one cohesive unit

6) Model and solve system F

7) Create a script that runs everything given the size of the grid as arguments so we only need to change one thing to make everything more/less accurate

8) Look into effect of larger/smaller grid sizes on memory use, CPU use, time taken, etc.

9) Somewhere in here we need to start work on individual / group reports and presentations.

10) Live hard. Party hard.
