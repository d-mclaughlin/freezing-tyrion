If you're unsure what to do with your time do something on this list. No particular orer but in general the higher up it is the more high priority it is.

1) Compare numerical and analytical results

2) Plot equipotential lines and electric field

3) Show the influence of the charge density on the electric field on the plot

5) Pull everything together into one cohesive unit -- working on it!

6) Model and solve system F

8) Look into effect of larger/smaller grid sizes on memory use, CPU use, time taken, etc.

9) Somewhere in here we need to start work on individual / group reports and presentations.

10) Live hard. Party hard.

11) We need some serious optimizations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The program takes way too long. Although, I understand that Laurynas did a thing with the residuals that will reduce the number of iterations we need to do to get a working solution. If we can do some more stuff in that sort of vein then I think we can reduce runtimes like cray-z.
